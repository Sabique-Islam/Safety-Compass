# **Safety Compass**  
A Smart Tool for Safer Travels  

## **NOTE:**
I couldn't find an API as per my project requirements,hence a custom JSON file (`safety_data.json`) was manually created.

As of now only a handful amount of data is stored, will keep updating it :)

## **Key Metrics Considered**  

Safety Compass assesses the following parameters to calculate a cityâ€™s safety rating:

- **Crime Rates**: Analysis of violent crimes (e.g., assaults, homicides), property crimes (e.g., theft, burglary), and cybercrimes.  
- **Law Enforcement**: Evaluates the effectiveness of law enforcement based on officer presence, response times, and community relations.  
- **Public Safety Infrastructure**: Considers the availability of emergency services and public surveillance systems.  
- **Traffic Safety**: Measures accident rates and the quality of the road infrastructure.  
- **Environmental Hazards**: Assesses natural disaster risks (e.g., earthquakes, floods) and pollution levels.  
- **Socioeconomic Factors**: Examines poverty levels, unemployment rates, and income inequality in the area.  
- **Public Health**: Takes into account access to healthcare services and disease prevalence.  
- **Community Engagement**: Looks at neighborhood safety initiatives and community safety programs.  
- **Emergency Preparedness**: Evaluates the presence of disaster response plans and public safety drills.  
- **Resident Perception**: Gathers insights on how safe locals feel and their trust in authorities.  
- **Tourism Safety**: Analyzes crime statistics related to tourists and safety measures in tourist areas.  
- **Technological Integration**: Considers the use of tech for crime prevention (e.g., crime mapping, reporting apps).
